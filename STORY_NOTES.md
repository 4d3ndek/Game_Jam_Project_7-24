# Story Specification Draft

## Worldbuilding

THE PROTAGONIST is an unnamed graduate student whose advisor tasks her with investigating the disappearance of (a rival? a relative? someone notable?) that they're personally invested in the disappearance of. The investigation ropes her into a conflict with a Fantasy Manhattan Project that has lots of closed-source research and is way more competent at shadowfuckery than anyone else.

Fantasy Manhattan Project is capable of using shadows as alchemic material, can steal the shadows of people, something something magnum opus

## Locations

YOUR LAB/OFFICE - tutorial area to demo mechanics in

STARTER AREA - investigation 1, where you explore and interview people. Maybe you get hit by hostile security on the way out?

## Mechanics/Movement Tech

PROTAGONIST's alchemy is restricted to small acts due to them having an incomplete version of the (philosopher's stone stand-in)

* Grid-aligned shadow wall that obstructs light/vision from passing through it
	* If you walk through the shadow wall, something should happen
* There's a specific material that allows the draining of umbriferous aether from a person's Shadow, which when used causes the body to build up excess energy since it's not being drained into the Shadow (sink), causing potentially lethal or at least hospitalizing effects that visually manifest as becoming a light source

## Ideas

* Tutorial level:
	* Looks like a fossil room, lots of sliding drawers/panels with tile flooring and stacks of stuff, and no windows
	* "Expended alchemy amulet gag": As part of the tutorial, the protag will be given an "expended" alchemic focus. As the advisor looks at their notes to describe how it's supposed to work. The protag will accidentally break it, which will allow it to recharge by drawing on the surrounding umbriferous aether(including their health). They be guided to practice the abilities, unknowingly, by the advisor reading their notes. Sequence ends with the advisor saying "... but none of that matters since it has expended its fuel."
	* Stacks of stuff
	* Have the professor notice you if you screw up an ability forcing you to restart if you fail it
	* Should have the option to skip the tutorial, maybe the character can just say they know how it works?
* Shadow alchemy ideas:
	* Umbral veil:
		* Veil looks like a wall of shadow obscuring the view to the other side
		* Walking through the veil makes you briefly invisible
	* Umbral sight:
		* Pathfinds to the exit or nearest focal point of shadow alchemy
		* see hidden messages
	* Umbral trap:
		* Place, then activates when a shadow passes over it, locks the owner of the shadow in place briefly
		* Alternatively, place under a barricade to briefly remove it.
	* Umbral speech:
		* Throw your speech to distract enemies
		* Access hidden knowledge about someone you're in conversation with (if you stand in their shadow?)(dialogue option)
	* Shadow puzzles that cast shadows on the ground to make symbols (open doors, activate other lights, hidden buttons, lift pedestal, rearange rooms)
	* Shadow abilities can be used by using Umbriferous Aether in your alchemic focus. Alchemic focus can be refueled with your own shadow (will reduce max health? and make you more visible until you sleep)
* Starter area ideas:
	* More advanced research lab with security agents stopping you from entering
		* Rival of protag's advisor claims a major breakthrough
		* Investigate the lab for while, then agents show up making getting out difficult(umbral sight enemies?)
	* Manor crime scene being blocked off by government agents
		* Rich benefactor dissapeared due to getting "stuck" in the Umbriferous Aether(can briefly talk with them through umbral sight?)
		* Child interfered with a ritual and is hiding the artifact used?
		* Tabloid reporters looking for a story
		* police don't know what's going on
	* Abandoned research site being looted by ???
* Enemies can be calm, alert, or in pursuit:
	* Calm: Stading around, regular movement
	* Alert: Turns sight line towards sound, sight line is extended
	* In pursuit: Follows last visible location of character
* Player can see enemy sight lines and hearing radii
