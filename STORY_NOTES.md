## Locations

YOUR LAB/OFFICE - tutorial area to demo mechanics in

STARTER AREA - investigation 1, where you explore and interview people. Maybe you get hit by hostile security on the way out?

PROTAGONIST's alchemy is restricted to small acts due to them having an incomplete version of the (philosopher's stone stand-in)
